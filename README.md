BC19.live - Unofficial Butte County COVID-19 Dashboard
======================================================

Butte County being my home county, I've been craving insight into the COVID-19
situation affecting my friends and family. Since the [official
dashboard](https://infogram.com/1pe66wmyjnmvkrhm66x9362kp3al60r57ex) is fairly
light on information, I've decided to take matters into my own hands and build
a new one.

The new [BC19.live](https://bc19.live) dashboard contains trends and insights
into the situation, including notable events, breakdowns of cases based on
hospitals, detailed hospital information, testing relative to the population,
and more.

The data is compiled from the Butte County dashboard, State hospital statistics
for the county, and other state data feeds, all pulled into a Google Sheets
document, compiled, exported to CSV, and translated to JSON. All sources are
made available.

This dashboard lives at [https://bc19.live/](https://bc19.live/), and will be
updated daily.
